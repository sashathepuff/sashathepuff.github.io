            <p>My name is Sasha Lee, and I just started coding. I have started rather late, as I am already in sixth grade. I haven't made a lot of programs/webpages yet, the only one I have made is Contrace, which I haven't finished. I would make some random BTS programs if I knew enough Javascript.</p>
